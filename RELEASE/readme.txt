Welcome to the DSPWG (Dead Simple Password Generator) readme.

In the release directory, there are two files:

dspwg.jar (JAVA JAR)
dspwg.exe (Windows EXE with the jar wrapped inside)

The .exe file was created with Launch4J.

Enter the password in the following syntax:
00x

With the 0's representing the length of the password and the x specifying the strength level.

Strength levels are: l, m, h
l = low
m = medium
h = high

For example, 16h would output a randomly generated 16-character string and copy the output into your clipboard.
